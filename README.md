# abkhaz-phonetics
R code for visualisation and modelling of Abkhaz phonetics data

## Description

There are three R scripts in this repository, each for evaluating particular hypotheses about the phonetics of Abkhaz stress against data collected from recordings with Abkhaz speakers made in 2022. Experiment 1(A) examines the acoustic differences between vowels with primary stress vs. no stress. Experiment 2 evaluates whether a category of secondary stress exists in Abkhaz. Experiment 3 evaluates whether there is a difference in the acoustics between an accented consonant followed by an unaccented vowel vs. an unaccented consonant followed by an accented vowel. For more details, see the full descriptions of each experiment in Andersson (2024).

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to the four Abkhaz speakers who contributed the data that this project is used to analyse: Astan Kucba, Zaira Khiba, and two speakers who wish to remain anonymous.
